# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-in-Julia
My journey into machine learning with julia

## Currently it has:
### 1. *Logistic regression with a neural network mindset using Julia ([github](https://github.com/Abhiswain97/Julia_ML/blob/master/deeplearning.ai/Neural%20Networks%20and%20deep%20learning/Week-2/2020-07-28-Logistic_regression-Copy1.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Abhiswain97/Julia_ML/blob/master/deeplearning.ai/Neural%20Networks%20and%20deep%20learning/Week-2/2020-07-28-Logistic_regression-Copy1.ipynb#))*
- It's Julia version of [Week 2 assignment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/notebook/zAgPl/logistic-regression-with-a-neural-network-mindset) of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome) course.

### 2. *Logistic regression applied to bank-note authentication ([github](https://github.com/Abhiswain97/Julia_ML/blob/master/deeplearning.ai/Neural%20Networks%20and%20deep%20learning/Week-2/2020-07-28-Logistic_regression.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Abhiswain97/Julia_ML/blob/master/deeplearning.ai/Neural%20Networks%20and%20deep%20learning/Week-2/2020-07-28-Logistic_regression.ipynb))*
- This is Logistic regression applied it to Bank note authentication.

## Blog post: 
The first one is also available as a blog post on my website if you prefer it that way -> [*Hello, Julia!*](https://abhishekswain.me/machine%20learning/maths/2020/07/28/Logistic_regression-Copy1.html)
